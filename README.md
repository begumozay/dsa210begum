# Analyzing Personal Netflix Viewing Patterns

## Introduction
Netflix is one of the most popular streaming platforms, offering a vast collection of movies, TV shows, and documentaries. Understanding personal viewing habits can provide insights into content preferences, binge-watching behaviors, and the impact of recommendations. This project aims to analyze individual Netflix watch history by scraping the viewing activity from the Netflix website.

## Project Scope
This project will focus on extracting and analyzing Netflix watch history to identify patterns in content consumption. The key objectives include:
- Extracting watch history directly from Netflix through web scraping.
- Analyzing watch time distribution and content preferences.
- Investigating seasonal or time-based trends in viewing behavior.

## Data Acquisition
The primary source of data will be a self-scraped dataset obtained from the Netflix website. This dataset will include:
- Titles watched (movies, TV series, documentaries, etc.).
- Date and time of viewing.
- Duration and frequency of watching.
- Genre categorization (if available).

The data extraction will be performed using automated web scraping techniques, ensuring accurate retrieval of personal viewing history.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removing duplicate entries and errors.
- Formatting timestamps for proper time-based analysis.
- Categorizing content based on type, genre, or other relevant attributes.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying peak watching hours and preferred genres.
- Detecting binge-watching patterns and content consumption trends.
- Analyzing how frequently different types of content are watched.

### 3. Trend Analysis
- Investigating how viewing habits change over time (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, seasonal patterns).
- Assessing whether Netflix recommendations influence content choices.

## Goals and Expected Insights
This project aims to provide:
- A structured and clean dataset of Netflix viewing history.
- A visual representation of personal content consumption trends.
- Meaningful insights into how and when Netflix is used.
